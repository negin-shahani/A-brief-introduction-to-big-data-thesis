# A-brief-introduction-to-big-data-thesis
Big data is a collection of huge and complex data sets and data volumes in terms of terabytes or petabytes, which includes a large volume of data, data management capabilities, social network analysis and real-time data. In this article, we presented the characteristics of "5V" in big data as well as the techniques and technologies used to handle big data.
Challenges include capturing, analyzing, storing, searching, sharing, visualizing and transmitting. The challenges are that you cannot use traditional SQL queries, nor can you use a relational database management system (RDBMS) for storage; However, a wide variety of scalable database tools and techniques have evolved. The best solution for this problem is to use Hadoop. Hadoop is an open-source, Java-based framework used to store and process big data, and its distributed file system enables parallel processing and fault tolerance.
